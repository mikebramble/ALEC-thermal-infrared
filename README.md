# ALEC-thermal-infrared
Repository of the processing pipeline to derive thermal emissivity spectra from thermal emission measurements with the Asteroid and Lunar Environment Chamber (ALEC) at Brown University.

This is the pipeline as presented in:

M. S. Bramble, Y. Yang, W. R. Patterson III, R. E. Milliken, J. F. Mustard, and K. L. Donaldson Hanna. 2019. Radiometric Calibration of Thermal Infrared Data from the Asteroid and Lunar Environment Chamber (ALEC). Review of Scientific Instruments 90, 093101. doi: 10.1063/1.5096363

I'm currently in the process of generalizing and uploading this pipeline. Check back later for a the complete pipeline.
